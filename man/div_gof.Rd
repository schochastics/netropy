\title{Divergence Tests of Goodness of Fit}
\usage{
div_gof(dat, var1, var2, var_cond = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{dataframe with rows as observations and columns as variables.
Variables must all be observed or transformed categorical with finite range spaces.}

\item{var1}{variable name as character in \code{dat} specified to be independent to
those specified in \code{var2} under \emph{p0}}

\item{var2}{variable name as character in \code{dat} specified to be independent to
those specified in \code{var1}}

\item{var_cond}{character of variable name in \code{dat} to condition the independence specification on,
must be different variables than those specified in \code{var1} and \code{var2}).
Default = empty (no conditioning).}
}
\value{
Message indicating whether the hypothesis with the specified independence model
can be rejected or not on approximately 5\% level of significance.
\item{summary}{Dataframe including the value of the divergence \emph{D} and its degrees of freedom}
}
\description{
Tests of various hypothetical structural models \emph{p0} against
the general model \emph{p} which is estimated using empirical data.
}
\details{
this function is currently implemented to only test goodness of fit of models specified as
\emph{X} independent of \emph{Y}, or \emph{X} independent of \emph{Y} given \emph{Z}.
