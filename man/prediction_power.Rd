\title{Prediction Power}
\usage{
prediction_power(var, dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{character string representing the variable in
dataframe \code{dat} to be predicted by pairs of other variables in the dataframe \code{dat}.}

\item{dat}{dataframe with rows as observations and columns as variables.
Variables must all be observed or transformed categorical with finite range spaces.}
}
\value{
Upper triangular matrix giving the expected conditional entropies of pairs of variables
given as rows and columns of the matrix. The diagonal gives \emph{EH(Z|X) = H(X,Z) - H(X)}, that is
when only one variable is used to predict \code{var}. Note that \code{NA}'s are in the entire
row and column representing the variable being predicted.
}
\description{
Computes prediction power when pairs of variables in a given dataframe are used
to predict a third variable from the same dataframe. The prediction strength is measured by
expected conditional entropies.
}
\details{
The expected conditional entropy given by\cr

\emph{EH(Z|X,Y) = H(X,Y,Z) - H(X, Y)} \cr

measures the prediction uncertainty when pairs of variables \emph{X} and \emph{Y}
are used to predict variable \emph{Z}.
The lower the value of \emph{EH} given different pairs of variables \emph{X} and \emph{Y},
the stronger is the prediction of \emph{Z}.

\examples{
# use internal data set
data(lawdata)
df.att <- lawdata[[4]]

# three steps of data editing:
# 1. categorize variables 'years' and 'age' based on
# approximately three equally size groups (values based on cdf)
# 2. make sure all outcomes start from the value 0 (optional)
# 3. remove variable 'senior' as it consists of only unique values (thus redundant)
df.att.ed <- data.frame(
    status = df.att$status,
    gender = df.att$gender,
    office = df.att$office - 1,
    years = ifelse(df.att$years <= 3, 0,
        ifelse(df.att$years <= 13, 1, 2)
    ),
    age = ifelse(df.att$age <= 35, 0,
        ifelse(df.att$age <= 45, 1, 2)
    ),
    practice = df.att$practice,
    lawschool = df.att$lawschool - 1
)

# power of predicting 'status' using pairs of other variables
