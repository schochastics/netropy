#' @title Association Graphs
#' @description Draws association graphs (graphical models) based on joint entropy values
#' to detect and visualize different dependence structures among the variables in the dataframe.
#' @param dat dataframe with rows as observations and columns as variables. Variables must all be observed or transformed categorical with finite range spaces.
#' @param cutoff the cutoff point for the edges to be drawn based on joint entropies. Default is 0 and draws all edges.
#' @return A ggraph object with nodes representing all variables in \code{dat} and edges
#' representing (the strength of) associations between them based on joint entropies.
#' @details Draws association graphs based on given thresholds of joint entropy values
#' between pairs of variables represented as nodes. Thickness of edges between pairs of nodes/variables
#' indicates the strength of dependence between them. Isolated nodes are completely
#' independent and paths through certain nodes/variables indicate conditional dependencies.
